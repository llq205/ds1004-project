For the first part of the project, we will analyze the data and generate a descriptive summary of their contents as well as a list of data quality issues. 


For the second part, we will integrate our selected collection with one or more data sets and look for interesting relationships between the data sets.


The dataset we will be using is NYPD Complaint Historical Data, which includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to the end of 2015.



All components of our project are reproducible.
